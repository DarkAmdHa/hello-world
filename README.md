My First Repo

Hello fellow humans

I am an aspiring software engineer, looking to finally get to know this quite irritantingly famous site that is GitHub.
For now I know a bit of css, html and javascript, alot of C++ and a bit of Java

Let us see where I'll be the next time I check this file.
Peace
